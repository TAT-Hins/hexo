## Special Thanks
There're always not enough words to express my countless gratefulness to my dear wife, **Naixin (Windy) Zhang**.
She currently works as a Ph.D student in **the College of IST(Informatic Science Technology) in the Pennsylvania State University.**
She's the one who gives me support in both physical, financial **and most importantly, mental** ways, and keeps encouraging me to do whatever I'm enthusiastic in and I'm good at as well.
